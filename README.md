# Tailwind-FB-Login-Page

It's just a practice project to judge myself if I'm able to work with tailwind css properly or not.

And amazingly I completed the Facebook Login Page in a shorter span of time.

# Why it's not Responsive

I didn't made the page responsive because facebook doesn't provide a responsive login page for their users. 

Facebook provides a different mobile version of fb for their login. As I made a Facebook clone, my version isn't responsive.

I'm going to build the same mobile version of the FB login page next.


# Production Ready!!!

Next I'm going to make it production ready. Because I made it with Tailwind CSS it uses a lot of utilities and node modules which consumes a bigger size. This big isn't production ready. 

So, I used NPM BUILD to make production ready. Now it will remove all the CSS I didn't used. 

And my production ready file will have only the css utilities i used in this project. So, the size won't be high any more.

All production bundles are ready
